{"task_name": "explanation", "judge_system_prompt": "Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the explanation provided by two AI assistants to the recommendation based on the user's history and target item.\nYou should evaluate these two explanation in three aspects respectively: informativeness, persuasiveness, and helpfulness.\nThe definition and scoring standard of these aspects is as follow:\n-----------------\nInformativeness: This metric measures whether the explanation can reveal more informative item features. The more detailed the explanation is about the item, the higher the informativeness score should be. You should check the real features of the given target item. And then compare to the information given in the AI assistants' explanation. And finally give the score. You should score the informativeness of each explanation on a scale of 1 to 3.\nFor each level of informativeness, I will give you some explanation examples that you can refer to. Text in the brackets is the reasons.\n- Informativeness: 1.\nstandard: The explanation cover nothing or only a few correct information of the target item. User can't get the correct information of the target item from the explanation.\nexplanation example 1: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended to the user because it is a good game.\nexplanation example 2: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended because it is a popular FPS game that this user is interested in according to the history. (Actually Watch_Dogs 2 is not a FPS game but a RPG game.)\n- Informativeness: 2.\nstandard: The explanation cover some information of the target item. but not mentioned the main features of the target item.\nexplanation example 1: This video is recommended to the user because Tom Cruise appears, which is of this user's interest. (But although Tom Cruise is in the video, he only appears for a very short time, and the real leading actor is Chris Pine.)\nexplanation example 2: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is recommended for you because it is a FPS game requires teamwork. (It only mention the most basic information of the target item. There are many games with this feature. But the most critic feature that makes this game different from others is players can utilize many different operators with different nationalities, weapons, and gadgets.)\n- Informativeness: 3.\nstandard: The explanation accurately introduces the detailed information of the target item, allowing users to clearly understand what kind of item it is.\nexplanation example 1: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended to the user because it is an open-world action-adventure game set in a near-future version of San Francisco, where the player takes on the role of Marcus Holloway, a hacker fighting against a corporation that controls the city's technology.\nexplanation example 2: Cuphead is recommended for the user because it is a classic run-and-gun action game with cartoon art style and challenging gameplay.\n-----------------\npersuasiveness: This metric measures whether the explanation can better persuade this user to click this item. The more features that are of interest to the current user are mentioned in the explanation, the higher the persuasiveness score should be. You should first analyze the user's preference from the user's history. And then check whether and how many features mentioned in the explanation will be interested by this user. And finally give the score. You should score the persuasiveness of each explanation on a scale of 1 to 3.\nFor each level of persuasiveness, I will give you some explanation examples that you can refer to. Text in the brackets is the reasons.\n- persuasiveness: 1.\nstandard: The explanation has mention nothing or only a few features that this user may interested in.\nexplanation example 1: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended to the user because it is a good game.\nexplanation example 2: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended to the user because it is a good RPG game. (But from the user's history, it only contain FPS games. This user is not interested in RPG games.)\n- persuasiveness: 2.\nstandard: The explanation has mentioned some features that this user may interested in. But also mentions other features this user may not interested in, or not mentioned complete interested features.\nexplanation example 1: This video is recommended to the user because Tom Cruise appears in the beginning, which is of this user's interest. While Chris Pine is the main character. (This user is not interested in Chris Pine.)\nexplanation example 2: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is recommended for you because it is a FPS game requires teamwork. (FPS is only one of the features attract this user.)\n- persuasiveness: 3.\nstandard: The explanation accurately points out the features of the item that will interest the user, so that the user is immediately interested in clicking.\nexplanation example 1: Cuphead is recommended for the user because it is a classic run-and-gun action game with unique art style and challenging gameplay. The user's history of playing games suggests that they enjoy exploration and immersive worlds, which Cuphead also offers. \nexplanation example 2: Black Desert Online is recommended for the user because it is a popular action role-playing game with a vast open world, a variety of character classes, and a player-driven economy. The user's history of playing games with similar mechanics and features, such as Team Fortress 2 and The Fifth Day, suggests that they may enjoy the fast-paced combat and strategic gameplay that Black Desert Online offers.\n-----------------\nhelpfulness: This metric measures whether the explanation can help this user to decide whether to click this item. You should score the helpfulness of each explanation on a scale of 1 to 3.\nFor each level of helpfulness, I will give you some explanation examples that you can refer to. Text in the brackets is the reasons.\n- helpfulness: 1.\nstandard: The explanation can't help the user to decide whether to click this item.\nexplanation example 1: Watch_Dogs 2 is recommended to the user because it is a good game.\nexplanation example 2: Watch_Dogs 2 is a popular game.\n- helpfulness: 2.\nstandard: The explanation can slightly help the user to decide whether to click this item.\n- helpfulness: 3.\nstandard: The explanation can nicely help the user to decide whether to click this item.\nexplanation example 1: This video is recommended to the user because Tom Cruise appears in the beginning, which is of this user's interest.

The user's history of playing games suggests that they enjoy exploration and immersive worlds, which Cuphead also offers.\n-----------------\nPlease follow the above definition and standard to score the three aspects of the explanation give by assistant A and B respectively. And then, give the overall result that which one is better, or tie. \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better, and \"[[C]]\" for a tie.\nPlease think step by step.
