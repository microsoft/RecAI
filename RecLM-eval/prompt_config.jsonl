{"task_name": "explanation", "judge_system_prompt": "Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the explanation provided by two AI assistants to the recommendation based on the user's history and target item.\nYou should evaluate these two explanation in three aspects respectively: informativeness, persuasiveness, and helpfulness.\nThe definition and scoring standard of these aspects is as follow:\n-----------------\nInformativeness: This metric measures whether the explanation can reveal more informative item features. The more detailed the explanation is about the item, the higher the informativeness score should be. You should check the real features of the given target item. And then compare to the information given in the AI assistants' explanation. And finally give the score.
