CANDIDATE_STORE_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is useful to save candidate {item}s into buffer as the initial candidates, following tools would filter or ranking {item}s from those canidates. \
For example, "Please select the most suitable {item} from those {item}s". \
Don't use this tool when the user hasn't specified that they want to select from a specific set of {item}s. \
The input of the tool should be a string of {item} names split by two ';', such as "{ITEM}1;; {ITEM}2;; {ITEM}3". 
"""


LOOK_UP_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is used to look up some {item} information in a {item} information table (including statistical information), like number of {item}s, description of {item}s and so on. \

The input of the tools should be a SQL command (in one line) converted from the search query, which would be used to search information in {item} information table. \
You should try to select as less columns as you can to get the necessary information. \
Remember you MUST use pattern match logic (LIKE) instead of equal condition (=) for columns with string types, e.g. "title LIKE '%xxx%'". \

For example, if asking for "how many xxx {item}s?", you should use "COUNT()" to get the correct number. If asking for "description of xxx", you should use "SELECT {item}_description FROM xxx WHERE xxx". \

The tool can NOT give recommendations. DO NOT SELECT id information!
"""


HARD_FILTER_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is a hard condition tool. The tool is useful when human expresses intentions about {item}s with some hard conditions on {item} properties. \
The input of the tool should be a one-line SQL SELECT command converted from hard conditions. Here are some rules: \
1. {item} titles can not be used as conditions in SQL;
2. the tool can not find similar {item}s;
3. always use pattern match logic for columns with string type;
4. only one {item} information table is allowed to appear in SQL command;
5. select all {item}s that meet the conditions, do not use the LIMIT keyword;
6. try to use OR instead of AND;
7. use given related values for categorical columns instead of human's description.

SOFT_FILTER_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is a soft condition filtering tool. \
The tool can find similar {item}s for specific seed {item}s. \
Never use this tool if human doesn't express to find some {item}s similar with seed {item}s. \
There is a similarity score threshold in the tool, only {item}s with similarity above the threshold would be kept. \
Besides, the tool could be used to calculate the similarity scores with seed {item}s for {item}s in candidate buffer for ranking tool to refine. \
The input of the tool should be a list of seed {item} titles/names, which should be a Python list of strings. \
Do not fake any {item} names.
"""


RANKING_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is useful to refine {item}s order (for better experiences) or remove unwanted {item}s (when human tells the {item}s he does't want) in conversation. \
The input of the tool should be a json string, which may consist of three keys: "schema", "prefer" and "unwanted". \
"schema" represents ranking schema, optional choices: "popularity", "similarity" and "preference", indicating rank by {item} popularity, rank by similarity, rank by human preference ("prefer" {item}s). \
The "schema" depends on previous tool using and human preference. If "prefer" info here not empty, "preference" schema should be used. If similarity filtering tool is used before, prioritize using "similarity" except human want popular {item}s.
"prefer" represents {item} names that human has enjoyed or human has interacted with before, which should be an array of {item} titles. Keywords: "used to do", "I like", "prefer".
"unwanted" represents {item} names that human doesn't like or doesn't want to see in next conversations, which should be an array of {item} titles. Keywords: "don't like", "boring", "interested in". 
"prefer" and "unwanted" {item}s should be extracted from human request and previous conversations. Only {item} names are allowed to appear in the input. \
The human's feedback for you recommendation in conversation history could be regard as "prefer" or "unwanted", like "I have tried those items you recommend" or "I don't like those".
Only when at least one of "prefer" and "unwanted" is not empty, the tool could be used. If no "prefer" info, {item}s would be ranked based on the popularity.\
Do not fake {item}s.
"""

MAP_TOOL_DESC = """
The tool is useful when you want to convert {item} id to {item} title before showing {item}s to human. \
The tool is able to get stored {item}s in the buffer and randomly select a specific number of {item}s from the buffer. \
The input of the tool should be an integer indicating the number of {item}s human needs. \
The default value is 5 if human doesn't give.
